Research Laboratory for Water Treatment and Resource Recovery

Nir Water Lab is part of the Zuckerberg Institute for Water Research, Ben-Gurion University, located in the heart of the Negev desert and equipped with cutting edge labs and analytical equipment. We are working on the development of novel physico-chemical processes for water/wastewater treatment, desalination and resource recovery, as well as on advanced process modeling, which couples geochemistry and mass-transport.
