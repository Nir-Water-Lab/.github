Research Lab for Water Treatment and Resource Recovery

Nir Water Lab is part of the Zuckerberg Institute for Water Research, located in the heart of the desert and equipped with cutting edge labs and analytical equipment. We are working on the development of novel physico-chemical processes for water/wastewater treatment, desalination and resource recovery, as well as on advanced process modeling, which couples geochemistry and mass-transport.
